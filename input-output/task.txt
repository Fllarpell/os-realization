Write a C program ex1.c that gets keyboard events directly from
the keyboard device and prints them to stdout.
Note: Try exploring
/dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd
You have to use the file
/dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd (or a similar
keyboard event character device file) for capturing keyboard
events. You should endlessly read from the file to get all events
You should use the input event structure from linux/input.h1
Only PRESSED, REPEATED and RELEASED events should be handled.
Print the output events in format: PRESSED 0x0023 (35)
Where PRESSED - type of event, 0x0023 and (35) are hex and
decimal representation of event code respectively.
The progam should be executed using sudo permission.
Th program should be terminated by pressing E+X.
Print and save the output to ex1.txt
Save the code in ex1.c
Modify previous program to output shortcuts: P+E → “I passed
the Exam!”, C+A+P → “Get some cappuccino!” and one custom
shortcut of your choice.
The program should print on the specified shortcuts in addition to
the output events (“PRESSED”, “RELEASED”, “REPEATED”).
Create the shortcut of your choice with custom message. The
number of keys should be at least 2 and no more than 6.
Print the available shortcuts at start of the program.
Print and append the output to ex1.txt.
Submit ex1.txt and ex1.c.
The source code in ex1.c should be well-documented and
explained.
