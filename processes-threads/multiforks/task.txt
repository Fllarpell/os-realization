In this exercise, you will do an experiment, observe and record the
results.
Write a program ex3.c that calls fork() in a loop for n times and
sleeps for 5 seconds after each call. Run the program as a
background process and then run pstree command several times.
The variable n should be read from the command line as an
argument and not from stdin.
Run the program for n=3. Look at the output and tell how many
processes are created. Explain the result.
Run the program so that it would call fork() 5 times. See how the
result changes.
