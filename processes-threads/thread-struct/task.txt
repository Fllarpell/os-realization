Create a struct Thread which contains three fields id which holds
the thread id, an integer number i and message as a string of size
256.
Write a program ex2.c that creates an array of n threads using
the struct Thread. The field i should store the index of the
created thread (0 for the first thread and so on) whereas the field
id contains the thread id and the field message contains the
message “Hello from thread i” where i is the value of the field i.
Each thread should output its id and message, then exit. Main
program should inform about thread creation by displaying the
message “Thread i is created”.
Do the threads print messages in the same order you created?
Fix the program to force the order to be strictly Thread 1 is
created, Thread 1 prints message, Thread 1 exits and so on.
Hint: use gcc -pthread ex2.c to compile.
Submit ex2.c and ex2.sh which runs the program.
