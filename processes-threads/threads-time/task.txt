Write a program ex1.c which creates two new processes, any of
them should not be a child of the other (their parents should be
the “main” process).
Print the ID of each three processes created in the program and
their parent IDs. Print the execution time for each process in
milliseconds. The execution time starts from the first instruction
after fork
