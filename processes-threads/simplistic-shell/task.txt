Write a program ex4.c to create your own simplistic shell. It
should read user input and be able to run a command without
arguments, such as pwd, ls, top, pstree and so on.
Extend your previous code to handle commands with arguments
and run the processes in background (another process). Do not
use here the shell operator & for running the process in the
background.
Note: Here, it is not permitted to use the library function system
but you should use one of the system calls for executing the
commands such as execve.
Hint: use man fork and man execve.
