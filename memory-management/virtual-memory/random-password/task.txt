Write a C program “ex1.c” which writes its pid in /tmp/ex1.pid
and generates a random password using the file /dev/random or
/dev/urandom. The password should start with “pass:”. It should
consist of only printable characters. The length is 8 characters.
Store the password in the memory using mmap (Create a shared
anonymous mapping) or in the heap. Then, the program waits in
an infinite loop.
Write a script “ex1 hack.sh” which reads the pages of the virtual
memory of the program “ex1.c” while it is running. It should find
the password that is generated by “ex1.c”. Print the password and
its memory address to stdout and send SIGKILL to the program
“ex1.c”.
Hints: You need to search in /proc/{pid}/mem, using xxd or gdb
commands. You may need to add sudo for these commands.
