Write a C program ex3.c, that runs for 10 seconds. Every second
it should:
allocate 10 MB of memory
fill it with zeros
print memory usage with getrusage() function
sleep for 1 second
Compile and run the program in the background (./ex3 &) and
run ’vmstat 1 ’ at the same time. Observe what happens to the
memory. Pay attention to si and so fields.
Add comments to ex3.txt with your findings.
Hint: use memset(ptr, value, size) to fill the allocated memory
